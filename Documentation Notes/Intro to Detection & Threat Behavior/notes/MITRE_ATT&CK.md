# Introduction to MITRE ATT&CK Framework

**MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally recognized framework that documents how real-world adversaries operate during cyberattacks.

## Structure of the Framework

The framework is organized in a **matrix** format representing different phases of an attack, known as **tactics**. Each tactic contains multiple **techniques**, and some techniques may include **sub-techniques** for more granular detail.

- **Reconnaissance** â€“ Using browsing services to find publicly available information  
- **Resource Development** â€“ Develop malware, obtain digital certificates  
- **Initial Access** â€“ Phishing, exploit public-facing applications  
- **Execution** â€“ PowerShell, command and scripting interpreters  
- **Persistence** â€“ Registry Run Keys, scheduled tasks  
- **Privilege Escalation** â€“ Exploitation for privilege escalation  
- **Defense Evasion** â€“ Obfuscated files or information  
- **Credential Access** â€“ Keylogging, credential dumping  
- **Discovery** â€“ System information discovery  
- **Lateral Movement** â€“ Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), SMB  
- **Collection** â€“ Screen capture, input capture  
- **Command and Control** â€“ DNS tunneling, web service usage  
- **Exfiltration** â€“ Exfiltration over HTTPS  
- **Impact** â€“ Data destruction, defacement


## Variants of ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK has several versions for different environments:

- **Enterprise** - Windows, Linux, macOS, Cloud
- **Mobile**
- **ICS** - Industrial Control Systems

## Mapping Log Events to ATT&CK Techniques

To apply MITRE ATT&CK effectively, security teams often map log events (from Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, etc.) to ATT&CK techniques. This mapping helps:

- Identify the **stage** of an attack
- Prioritize **alerts** based on tactics and techniques
- Detect anomalies aligned with known **adversary behavior**

### Example:

| Log Source     | Event ID | Observed Behavior           | ATT&CK Technique                  |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sysmon         | 1        | PowerShell Execution        | `T1059.001 - PowerShell`          |
| Windows Events | 4624     | Successful Logon            | `T1078 - Valid Accounts`          |
| Sysmon         | 11       | File Created in Startup Dir | `T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys`   |

>[!TIP]
>
>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools like **Splunk**, **ELK**, or **Microsoft Sentinel** can automate this mapping using detection rules or correlation engines.

## Open Source Projects
Several open-source tools and projects help integrate ATT&CK into detection, analysis, and red teaming workflows:
