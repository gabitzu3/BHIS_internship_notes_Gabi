# Zeek 

Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is a powerful network security monitoring platform. Unlike traditional packet analyzers, Zeek operates as a network security engine that passively monitors traffic and generates rich logs describing network activity. For SOC Analysts, Zeek is invaluable for detecting anomalies, understanding protocol behavior, and performing incident response.

## Installation

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install zeek
  ```

  Or compile from source via [https://zeek.org/get-zeek/](https://zeek.org/get-zeek/)

- **Security Onion**: Comes pre-installed

- **Zeek in Docker**:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it --net=host zeek/zeek zeek -i eth0
  ```

---

##  Zeek Architecture Overview

Zeek consists of multiple components:

- **Packet Capture** (via `libpcap`)
- **Event Engine** (parses protocols and extracts metadata)
- **Policy Scripts** (detect specific behaviors or extract logs)
- **Log Framework** (generates structured `.log` files)

Zeek uses a powerful scripting language for writing detection logic.

---

## Interface & CLI Tools

Zeek does not have a GUI; it works primarily through the command line and log files.

- **Basic Syntax**:
  ```bash
  zeek -i <interface>
  zeek -r <pcap_file>
  ```
- **Output**: Produces logs in the current directory (e.g., `conn.log`, `dns.log`, `http.log`, `notice.log`, etc.)

## Core Zeek Log Files (Essential for SOC)

| Log File       | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `conn.log`     | All connections (source/destination IP, ports, protocol, duration) |
| `dns.log`      | DNS requests and responses                                         |
| `http.log`     | HTTP request/response metadata                                     |
| `ssl.log`      | TLS handshake data (JA3, certs, versions)                          |
| `files.log`    | Metadata about extracted files/transfers                           |
| `notice.log`   | Alerts and notable events from scripts                             |
| `weird.log`    | Protocol anomalies and unexpected behavior                         |
| `x509.log`     | Parsed SSL certificates                                            |
| `software.log` | Detected software on hosts                                         |
| `ssh.log`      | SSH handshake metadata                                             |
| `smtp.log`     | Email-related traffic (SMTP only)                                  |

## Zeek Scripts: Behavioral Detection

Zeek's power comes from its scripting engine. Examples:

### Detect long connections

```zeek
redef Notice::policy += {
  [$note=Conn::LongConnection, $priority=Notice::WARNING]
};
```

### Alert on cleartext password in HTTP

```zeek
event http_entity_data(c: connection, is_orig: bool, data: string) {
  if (data in /password=/) {
    print fmt("Password detected: %s", data);
  }
}
```

Scripts can be custom-built or use community ones from:

- [https://packages.zeek.org/](https://packages.zeek.org/)

## Use Cases

| Use Case                    | Zeek Artifact           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Lateral movement            | `conn.log`, `ssh.log`   |
| DNS tunneling               | `dns.log`               |
| C2 beaconing                | `conn.log`, `http.log`  |
| Exfiltration via HTTP/FTP   | `files.log`, `http.log` |
| TLS anomalies (self-signed) | `ssl.log`, `x509.log`   |
| Protocol abuse              | `weird.log`             |
| Unauthorized remote access  | `ssh.log`, `conn.log`   |
| Email-based attacks         | `smtp.log`              |

## Useful Tools and Add-ons

- **ZeekCTL** â€“ Cluster management tool
  ```bash
  zeekctl deploy
  zeekctl status
  ```
- **File carving**: Can extract files (enabled in config)
- **Intel framework**: Add threat intel to flag IOCs
- **Notice framework**: Send alerts to SIEM or syslog
- **Input framework**: Ingest feeds for detection (e.g., blacklists)

---

## TLS/SSL Analysis

Zeek can fingerprint TLS connections:

- **JA3 Fingerprinting**
- Certificate issuer and validity
- Weak TLS versions (e.g., SSLv3)

Use `ssl.log` and `x509.log` to detect expired, self-signed, or suspicious certs.

---

## Best Practices

- Periodically rotate and archive logs
- Forward logs to SIEM for correlation
- Watch `notice.log` and `weird.log` daily
- Write custom scripts for your use cases
- Leverage Zeek + Suricata (Security Onion) for layered detection
